At first this looks pretty complicated, but we will go Step-by-Step with Pictures *(when available)* trough the whole Set-Up Process and explain alongside.
## Positive 
- üëç can be used with a single Internet connection from Phone
- üëç when connection is failing from Phone to Internet, the Viewer will still see Videos/Clips
- üëç a second internet can be added to make Phone Stream more reliable
- üëç when switching from WiFi to Mobile and back stream is not going offline
## Negative
- üëé Additional monthly cost for Relay Server ($10 USD)
- üëé Additional monthly cost for 2nd Internet if (Optional)
- üëé Takes some time for first Setup

# Make OBS pretty
We are finished with the basic Setup, but the Scenes are pretty emtpy.
Following is an Explanation on what Scene is used for what and what People normally put in. These are just recommendations. Feel free to design however you want.

### Starting
- Every time the Stream starts with this scene until the phone is live
- Video+Music is often used as Background
- simple Text "Starting Soon ..."
### Live
- As soon as there is a connection from the Phone to OBS this will be shown
- No additional things needed, since Overlays should run on the Phone
### Low
- When connection to the Phone is bad quality
- simple Text "low bitrate"
### Disconnected
- When the connection to Phone is lost completely this is shown
- old Stream or Clips are often used
- simple Text "Lost connection..." on Top
- simple Text "Be right back"
### Privacy
- Can be activated by writing !privacy in Twitch-Chat
- Similar to Disconnected
- Can be switched to when you go to Toilet or have private Conversation for a few Minutes
### Ending
- Can be activated by writing !ending in Twitch-Chat
- Similar to Starting Video+Music
- Simple Text "Ending Stream"
---
# First Test
1. to Start the stream, go into your Twitch Chat and enter **!start**
OBS will now start the Stream in the **Starting**-Scene
2. Go to your Streaming Phone into the **Moblin**-App and start your Stream there
3. After a few Seconds the Stream from the Phone reaches the OBS and NOALBS switches to **Live-Scene**
4. When you loose Connection or you stop the Stream in **Moblin**-App,
it should automatically switch to **Disconnected** and back as soon as Phone Stream is ok again.
5. You can manually switch to **Privacy** with the Chat-Command **!privacy** and back with **!live**
6. To End your Stream you either put **!stop** into Twitch-Chat or you make a Raid to another Streamer
---
# Final Notes
## 2nd Internet Connection
As seen in the Plan there should be 2x Internet Connection for your phone to reduce the chance of outtages for the Live Stream. Either a Mobile WiFi Router or a Second Phone with Mobile Hotspot active. For this second SIM a different Provider is highly recommended.
*Note: that the 2nd Sim will also consume Data*
